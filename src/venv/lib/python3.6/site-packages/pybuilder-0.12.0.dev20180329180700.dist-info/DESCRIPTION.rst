PyBuilder is a software build tool written in 100% pure Python, mainly
targeting Python applications.

PyBuilder is based on the concept of dependency based programming, but
it also comes with a powerful plugin mechanism, allowing the
construction of build life cycles similar to those known from other
famous (Java) build tools.

PyBuilder is running on the following versions of Python: 2.7, 3.4, 3.5,
3.6, 3.7, PyPy 2.7, and PyPy 3.5.

See the `Travis Build <https://travis-ci.org/pybuilder/pybuilder>`__ for
version specific output.

Installing
----------

PyBuilder is available using pip:

::

    $ pip install pybuilder

For development builds use:

::

    $ pip install --pre pybuilder

See the `Cheeseshop
page <https://warehouse.python.org/project/pybuilder/>`__ for more
information.

Getting started
---------------

PyBuilder emphasizes simplicity. If you want to build a pure Python
project and use the recommended directory layout, all you have to do is
create a file build.py with the following content:

.. code:: python

    from pybuilder.core import use_plugin

    use_plugin("python.core")
    use_plugin("python.unittest")
    use_plugin("python.coverage")
    use_plugin("python.distutils")

    default_task = "publish"

See the `PyBuilder homepage <http://pybuilder.github.com/>`__ for more
details and a list of plugins.
